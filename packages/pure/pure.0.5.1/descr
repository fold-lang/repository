Pure

A small and modular base library for OCaml.

## Goals

**Extensibility**

Pure is designed to be easily extensible by external libraries. A set of fundamental primitives are included and are thought to be extended by concrete implementations.

**Composability**

The central focus of the library is the creation and promotion of a shared language for expressing concepts, behaviours and invariants. The same vocabulary is used across all the modules to ensure a composable and predictable API.

For example there is small `Int` module which implements the following interfaces: _Bounded_, _Comparable_, _Default_, _Enumerable_, _Equatable_, _Hashable_, _Numeric_, _Parsable_ and _Printable_.
